        Artist Statement
      </h2>
      <p>
        The process of creating art, along with its relationship to shapes and
        lines, gives me a feeling of nostalgia and calmness. My art allows me to
        not only time travel to a past that cannot be otherwise reached – it
        produces a continuum between the past and the present that I can access
        and find new, surprising information for me to digest and think more
        about life for being human. The sky I looked up at eight years old is
        the same sky I see today, and I express that through my artwork; the
        green leaf falling by me at six years old produces the same feeling in
        me when a red leaf falls to the ground today, and I represent that
        through my art. <br /><br />
        My artwork explores the intersection of the past and the present, as
        well as the beautiful tensions emerge as a result. Over the last several
        years, I have devoted myself to studying Japanese history and culture,
        particularly with an eye on mingei – or art objects made by ordinary
        people during the Edo period. I continually ask myself what it means to
        incorporate and reimagine mingei in today’s modern art context; this
        question allows me to creatively bridge a gap of over four hundred years
        and shed new light on a tradition not only time-honored, but time-bound
        as well.
