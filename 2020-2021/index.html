          Celebrating the San Jos&eacute State University MFA Graduates
          2019-2021
        </h2>
        <p>
          This site serves as a showcase and archive for the combined Fall 2019
          - Spring 2021 graduating MFAs from San José State University.
          <br /><br />
          As with so many things in our lives, this trajectory was disrupted in
          Spring of 2020; the production of the exhibition and catalogue put on
          hold while the world grappled with the global pandemic.<br /><br />
          In Fall of 2020, graduates elected to combine their efforts in a joint
          exhibition and catalogue featuring work from a selection of artists
          from the graduating classes of Fall 2019 through Spring 2021 who were
          able to participate. This website reflects the combined curatorial,
          administrative, creative, and scholastic efforts during a period where
          hard stops in the timeline softened; the culmination is a blending of
          shared resources and efforts.

          Overview
        </h2>
        <p>
          As a component of their degree, MFA Candidates at San Jose State
          University mount two exhibits housed within one of six University
          Galleries; one exhibition in their second year of study and a
          culminating Thesis Exhibition at the end of their third year. In
          addition to the Solo Thesis Exhibitions installed on campus, MFA
          Candidates have the option of participating in a group exhibition
          hosted off-site & pairing with an MA Candidate in Art History and
          Visual Culture to create an entry in the annual, Lift-off Catalogue.
          Past exhibitions have been installed at Root Division (SF), Incline
          Gallery (SF), Pro Arts (Oakland), and the San Jose Institute for
          Contemporary Art. Recent Curatorial advisors for the exhibition
          include Chris Gurnder & Cléa Massiani (Co-Directors of Bass & Rainer,
          SF), Kevin Chen (Independent Curator), and in this iteration, Marcella
          Faustini (co-Director of CLOACA Projects, SF).<br /><br />

          Art students at San José State join a legacy of thinkers, activists,
          and innovators dedicated to the public good. They test ideas through
          experimentation in the university’s robust fabrication studios, which
          support the technical components of artistic production in ceramics,
          digital media, metals, glass, painting, photography, printmaking, and
          sculpture. Individual studios create space for deep thinking and
          artistic creation; adjacent communal work areas engender peer-to-peer
          dialogue and foster innovation and intellectual rigor. <br /><br />

          Students combine their in-class experiences, faculty mentorship,
          independent research, and individual studio practices to produce these
          exhibitions. The transformations that occur through interdisciplinary
          dialogue and pedagogical stewardship are nowhere more evident than in
          these markers of educational maturation. <br /><br />

          The culminating group exhibit and accompanying catalog, produced at
          the end of students’ final year of study, reveal the synergies that
          emerge from the diversity of learning practices. The artworks speak to
          critical issues far beyond the University grounds; that inevitably
          direct graduates' thinking, making, and far beyond their time at San
          Jose State University.<br /><br />
