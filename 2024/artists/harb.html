        Artist Statement
      </h2>
      <p>
        In my recent work I have been painting from direct observation, based on my current situation and daily surroundings.  I mainly have been working from the human figure and objects.  In my current body of work, my girlfriend has been my main sitter, making for a more intimate intention in the way I paint. I also have been making still life paintings from objects I have been assembling together in my own home.  In this way, I hope to find a universal subject matter in my own intimate situation. I also paint myself, focusing on how my appearance changes throughout the day. The main focus in this work is a very familiar human body, and very familiar objects/surroundings.  There is a sense of collaboration when working from another person, regarding what they are willing to contribute into the painting I set forth working on.  Also, my own home space has been sort of like a central figure in my current work.  Perhaps, especially during the time of Covid-19, making your home life a primary focus of concern, seems to hit the nail on the head.
